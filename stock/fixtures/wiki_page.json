  "content": "Closing Stock Balance\nHow the Stock Balance Report is Prepared \nThe Stock Balance report is a crucial tool for businesses to monitor their inventory levels and make informed decisions. It consists of four main columns: Opening Stock, In Stock, Out Stock, and Balance Stock. The Balance Stock is calculated using the formula Opening Stock + In Stock - Out Stock.\n\nOne of the key challenges in preparing the Stock Balance report is the calculation of the Opening Stock. To determine the Opening Stock, the system reads all the rows in the Stock Ledger Entry table that come before the specified From Date filter. However, a potential issue arises when the filter for item code or warehouse is not set, and the Stock Ledger Entry table contains a vast number of records. This situation can significantly slow down the process and cause performance problems.\n\nClosing Stock Balance \n\n\nTo address this issue, a solution has been introduced - the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature. This feature allows the system to prepare the Opening Stock in advance, reducing the time taken to generate the Stock Balance report.\n\nHere's how to use the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature effectively:\n\nClosing Stock Balance Creation: After the financial year has ended, and the necessary audits have been completed for that year (in this example, the financial year 2022-2023), you should create the Closing Stock Balance. This should be done for the specific end date of the financial year 2022-2023.\n\nData Preparation: Once the Closing Stock Balance is submitted, the system will take some time to prepare the data. During this process, the Opening Stock values are calculated and stored for future use.\n\nUtilizing Closing Stock Balance: With the Closing Stock data prepared, the system will utilize this data to generate the Stock Balance report efficiently. Now, whenever a user opens the Stock Balance Report, the system can quickly read the necessary data from the Closing Stock Balance for the Opening Stock values.\n\nAnnual Closing Stock Balance: It is essential to create the closing stock balance every year after the closing of the financial year. This ensures that the Opening Stock values are updated and accurate for each reporting period.\n\nBy implementing the \"Closing Stock Balance\" feature and following the recommended steps, businesses can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of generating Stock Balance reports, even with a vast amount of data in the Stock Ledger Entry table.",

  "content": "Purchase Order\nA Purchase Order is a binding contract with your Supplier that you promise to buy a set of items under given conditions.\n\nIt is similar to a Sales Order but instead of sending it to an external party, you keep it for internal records.\n\n> Home > Buying > Purchasing > Purchase Order\n\nBuying Flow\n\n1.

If you set a Pricing List, then the item prices will be fetched from that list. Ticking on Ignore Pricing Rule will ignore the Pricing Rules set in Accounts > Pricing Rule.\n\nRead about Price Lists and Multi-Currency Transactions to know more.\n\n3.3 Subcontracting or 'Supply Raw Materials' \nSetting 'Supply Raw Materials' option is useful for subcontracting where you provide the raw materials for manufacturing an item. To know more, visit the Subcontracting page.\n\n3.4 The Items table \nScan Barcode: You can add Items in the Items table by scanning their barcodes if you have a barcode scanner. Read documentation for tracking items using barcode to know more.\n\nQuantity and Rate: When you select the Item code, it's name, description, and UOM will be fetched.

'Last Purchase Rate' shows the rate of the item from your last Purchase Order. Rate is fetched if set in the item master. You can attach an Item Tax Template to apply a specific tax rate to the item.\n\nItem weights will be fetched if set in the Item master else enter manually.\n\nWarehouse: The warehouse where the items will be delivered, will be auto-filled if 'Set Target Warehouse' was set in the Purchase Order. Via Blanket Order, a Blanket Order can be linked, to know more click here. A 'Project' can be linked to track progress. A 'BOM' or Bill of Materials can also be linked to track progress.\n\n'Qty as per Stock UOM' will show the current stock as per the UOM set in the Item master. 'Received Qty' will be updated when the items are billed.\n\nAccounting Details: This section is autofilled for a Purchase Order. 'Expense Account' is the account against which the PO is billed and Cost Center is the CC against which the PO is charged.\n\nA “Required By” date on each Item: If you are expecting part delivery, your Supplier will know how much quantity to deliver at which date. This will help you from preventing over-supply. It will also help you to track how well your Supplier is doing on timeliness.\n\nAllow Zero Valuation Rate: Ticking on 'Allow Zero Valuation Rate' will allow submitting the Purchase Receipt even if the Valuation Rate of the Item is 0. This can be a sample item or due to a mutual understanding with your Supplier.\n\n3.6 Raw Materials Supplied \nThis section appears when 'Supply Raw Materials' supplied is set to 'Yes'. This section shows a table with the Items to be supplied to the Supplier for the subcontracting process.\n\nSet Reserve Warehouse: When Subcontracting, the raw materials can be reserved in a separate Warehouse. On selecting the Reserved Warehouse here, it'll be fetched into Item rows of the Raw Materials Supplied table.\nSupplied Items Table \nRequired Quantity: The count of Items required to complete the subcontracting as specified in the BOM.\nSupplied Quantity: This will be updated when you create Stock Entries to transfer materials to Supplier Warehouse from the Reserve Warehouse using the Transfer button.

Note that the UOM in the Item master is the stock UOM.\n\nIn the Purchase Order mention UOM as Box. (Since material arrives in Boxes)\n\nIn the Warehouse and Reference section, the UOM will be pulled in as Nos (from the Item form):\n\nPurchase Order - UOM\n\nMention the UOM conversion factor. For example, (1); If one box has 1 kilo.\n\nNotice that the stock quantity will be updated accordingly.\n\nPurchase Order - UOM\n\n3.8 Taxes and Charges \nIf your Supplier is going to charge you additional taxes or charge like a shipping or insurance charge, you can add it here. It will help you to accurately track your costs. Also, if some of these charges add to the value of the product you will have to mention them in the Taxes table.\n\nVisit the Purchase Taxes and Charges Template page to know more about taxes.\n\nThe total taxes and charges will be displayed below the table.\n\nTo add taxes automatically via a Tax Category, visit this page.\n\nMake sure to mark all your taxes in the Taxes and Charges table correctly for an accurate valuation.\n\nShipping Rule \nA Shipping Rule helps set the cost of shipping an Item. The cost will usually increase with the distance of shipping. To know more, visit the Shipping Rule page.\n\nPurchase Order Taxes\n\nFor example, you buy Items worth X and sell them for 1.3X. So your Customer pays 1.3 times the tax you pay your Supplier. Since you have already paid tax to your Supplier for X, what you owe your government is only the tax on 0.3X.\n\nThis is very easy to track in ERPNext since each tax head is also an Account. Ideally you must create two Accounts for each type of VAT you pay and collect, “Purchase VAT-X” (asset) and “Sales VAT-X” (liability), or something to that effect.\n\n3.9 Additional Discount \nOther than recording discount per item, you can add a discount to the whole purchase order in this section. This discount could be based on the Grand Total i.e., post tax/charges or Net total i.e., pre tax/charges. The additional discount can be applied as a percentage or an amount.\n\nRead Applying Discount for more details.\n\n3.10 Payment Terms \nSometimes payment is not done all at once. Depending on the agreement, half of the payment may be made before shipment and the other half after receiving the goods/services. You can add a Payment Terms template or add the terms manually in this section.\n\nRead Payment Terms to know more.\n\n3.11 Terms and Conditions \nIn Sales/Purchase transactions there might be certain Terms and Conditions based on which the Supplier provides goods or services to the Customer. You can apply the Terms and Conditions to transactions to transactions and they will appear when printing the document. To know about Terms and Conditions, click here\n\n3.12 Print Settings \nLetterhead \nYou can print your request for quotation / purchase order on your company's letterhead. Know more here.\n\n'Group same items' will group the same items added multiple times in the items table. This can be seen when your print.\n\nPrint Headings \nTitles of your documents can be changed. Know more here.\n\nThe seller's Additional Discount, Payment Terms, Terms and Conditions can be recorded in your Purchase Order.\n\n3.13 More Information \nThis section shows the status of the Purchase Order, percentage of items received, and percentage of items billed. If this is an Inter Company Order, the Sales Order can be linked here.\n\n3.14 After Submitting \nOnce you “Submit” your Purchase Order, you can trigger actions these actions:\n\nYou can Add, Update, Delete items in the Purchase Order by clicking on the Update Items button. However you cannot delete items which has already been received.\n\nStatus: Once submitted, you can hold a Purchase Order or Close it.\n\nCreate: From a submitted Purchase Order, you can create the following:\n\nPurchase Receipt - A receipt indicating you've received the items.\nPurchase Invoice - An invoice/bill for the purchase order.\nPayment Entry - A payment entry indicates that payment has been made against a purchase order.\nJournal Entry - A Journal Entry is recorded in the general ledger.\nPurchase Order post submitting",

ERPNext allows you to manage all sorts of items like raw-materials, sub-assemblies, finished goods, item variants, and service items.\n\nERPNext is optimized for itemized management of your sales and purchase. If you are in services, you can create an Item for each service that you offer. Completing the Item Master is very essential for the successful implementation of stock.\n\nTo access the Item list, go to: > Home > Stock > Items and Pricing > Item\n\n1.

You can also generate Item Code based on a Naming Series by enabling this feature in Stock Settings.\n\nItem Group: Item Group is used to categorize an Item under various criteria like products, raw materials, services, sub-assemblies, consumables or all Item groups. Create your default Item Group list under Setup > Item Group and pre-select the option while filling your New Item details under Item Group. Item groups can be sub-assemblies, raw materials, etc, or based on your business use case.\n\nDefault Unit of Measure: This is the default measuring unit that you will use for your product.

  "content": "Warehouse\nA warehouse is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc.\n\nThey are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of cities, towns, and villages. They mostly have loading docks to load and unload goods from trucks.\n\nThe terminology of 'Warehouse' in ERPNext is a bit broader though and maybe can be regarded as \"storage locations\". You can create a sub-Warehouse which could be a shelf inside your actual location.\n\nThis can become quite a detailed Tree like the following:\n\nWarehouse > Room > Row > Shelf > Bin\n\nTo access the Warehouse list, go to: > Home > Stock > Settings > Warehouse\n\n1. How to create a Warehouse \nGo to the Warehouse list, click on New.\nEnter a name for the Warehouse.\nSet/check the Parent Warehouse. If you tick on 'Is Group', you can create sub-Warehouses under this group Warehouse.\nSave.\nWarehouses are saved with their respective Company’s abbreviations. This facilitates identifying which Warehouse belongs to which company at a glance.\n\n1.1 Additional options when creating a Warehouse \nAccount: Set a default account here for all transactions with this Warehouse. Setting this account will show transactions from this Warehouse in the Accounting Ledger. Warehouse Type: You can create a Warehouse Type to classify Warehouses. For example, Supplier Warehouses, Stock Warehouses, WIP Warehouses, Rooms, etc. can be tagged. This classification is useful when generating reports or in certain stock transactions.\n\nAddress and contact \nYou can add Billing, Shipping, and other types of addresses for the Warehouse. You can also add a contact, this could be the Warehouse Manager for example.\n\nWarehouse\n\n1.2 After Saving \nAfter saving a Warehouse, you'll see the following options:\n\nStock Balance: This will open the Stock Balance report to display the quantity, valuation, balance, etc.\nGeneral Ledger: This will open the General Ledger to display the accounting transactions.\nNon-Group to Group: If the Warehouse is a Non-Group Warehouse, i.e. cannot contain other Warehouses under it, this button will make this a Group Warehouse.\n2. Features \n2.1 Tree View \nYou can also switch to 'Tree' View which will show all the group and child Warehouses.\n\nWarehouse\n\n2.2 Warehouse Account \nIn ERPNext, if you enable Perpetual Inventory, every Warehouse must belong to a specific company to maintain company-wise stock balance. To do so, each Warehouse should be linked with an Account in the Chart of Accounts (the same name as the Warehouse itself). This account captures the monetary equivalent of the goods or materials stored in that specific warehouse.\n\nIf you have a more detailed Warehouse Tree, most likely it's a good idea to link the sub-locations (room, row, shelf, etc.) to the account of the actual Warehouse (the root Warehouse of that Tree) as most scenarios do not require to account for value of stock items per Shelf or Bin. For example, if you have Warehouse A, and the room, rows are B, C, etc., then link B and C to the account of A.\n\n> Tip: ERPNext maintains stock balance for every distinct combination of Item and Warehouse. Thus you can get the stock balance for any specific Item in a particular Warehouse on any particular date.\n\n",
